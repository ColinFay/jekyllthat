# jekyllthat

Basic RMarkdown to Github Flavored Jekyll, usefull for writting posts on a blog hosted on GitHub, straight from RStudio. 

## About

If ever you start a blog today, you definitely should use [Blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown), which is the best tool to create a blog within RStudio. 

But if (as me), you haven't had the time to convert your blog to Blogdown, this package is here to help you being more efficient with RStudio and Jekyll. This is the package I use for [colinfay.me](colinfay.me).

{jekyllthat} contains : 

+ An RStudio Rmd template that you can get from New File > RMarkdown > From Template

+ A Markdown format to turn Rmd into a github md for Jekyll. If you're not using the template, add to your Rmd yaml : 

`output: jekyllthat::jekylldown`

## Worflow

### Before using 

The easier worflow is to keep your Rmd inside the `_posts` folder. If you want to do that, you should specify jekyll to ignore this in your config.yml. You can manually specifiy this in the `exclude` part, by adding : 

  - "*.Rmd"

You can also use the `config_rmd()`, that takes as argument the path to your `config.yml`. But as it is a 15 seconds job to do it manually, you should definitely do it manually.
